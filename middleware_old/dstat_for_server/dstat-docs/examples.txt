= Dstat examples

I've written a few examples that make use of the Dstat classes.

The following examples currently exist:

    read.py   - shows how to access dstat data
    mstat.py  - small sub-second ministat tool

Please send other examples or tools that make use of Dstat classes
or changes to extend the current infrastructure.

I'm not particularly happy with the current interface to Dstat,
so any hints on how to improve it are welcome. Also look at the
TODO for future changes.


NOTE: Please send me improvements to this document.
